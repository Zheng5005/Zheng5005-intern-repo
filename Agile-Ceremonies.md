## How do Agile ceremonies help with **communication and alignment**?
These ceremonies provide a predictable and transparent framework that keeps teams aligned, focused and allow team to communicate effectively.

## Which ceremony do you think is **most important for your role**, and why?
In my case (frontend development) I think the most important ceremony is the backlog refinement, cause once the requirements and goals are rightfully set, the development of any UI is faster and easer.

## A change I can make to improve my team collaboration
Improving my communication skills to deliver better feedback to the team.
