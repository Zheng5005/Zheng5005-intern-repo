## How do Agile ceremonies help with **communication and alignment**?
These ceremonies provide a predictable and transparent framework that keeps teams aligned, focused and allow team to communicate effectively.

## Which ceremony do you think is **most important for your role**, and why?
In my case (frontend development) I think the most important ceremony is the backlog refinement, cause once the requirements and goals are rightfully set, the development of any UI is faster and easer.

## A change I can make to improve my team collaboration
Improving my communication skills to deliver better feedback to the team, this means:
- Being specific and clear with any Issue or trouble I might have
- Not bothering my co-workers for answer every time I had troubles
- Instead of just delivering questions, I also had to offers some solutions (at least some ideas) to speed up the process

An example of the above will be when I have a problem that I need to solve:
1. Research what is the bug that is causing problems
2. Trying to find the solution to the bug
3. If the solution isn't found I would resort to AI
4. If the solution isn't found yet, I would document the previous steps to give more context to any co-worker
5. I would ask for help and send the documentation from the previous step.
6. When the bug is fixed, adding that solution to the documentation as well
6. In the meeting I would descriptive the bug, what was causing it, the solution I (or with the help of any Co-worker) implemented, and I also would send the full documentation in order to anyone to see the process.
## Evidence of agile ceremonies participations
For this I can't show any details nor a screenshot, but what I can say is that for the stand-up meeting (circa march, 2025) with everyone in the team (including the client) is that is was centered on delimiting and defining the final product, what it should and what it shouldn't do, and also to answer any question and clarify somethings that the cliend had.

For the retrospective (around june, 2025), something I notice (and I said in the meeting) is that each menmber of the team had a different Definition of Done, and to prevent ant Issue to be "resolved" when they didn't meet the requirements, it was established a more strict definition, including test and expected outputs
