## Why do you think Focus Bear was created?
Focus Bear was created cause of the needs of people with AuDHD, cause other apps don't consider this needs, leaving this people with no other option than adapt to the specific app, Focus Bear tries to tackle this issue by implementing AuDHD friendly features and design, without leaving user with no AuDHD behind.
## What problem is Focus Bear solving?
Mainly it solves productivity and habit adherence (executive functions) problems
## Why do you think this mission is important?
Is crucial to tackle this issues, cause it can cause a mental and physical toll for people in the long run, it can affect their work and personal life, it also can lead to a tragic outcome because of the stigma that one can have if they have problems with productivity.
## How does Focus Bear’s work align with your personal values or interests?
For me it aligns to my interest, at the moment I want to learn and be more productive, so using an app like Focus Bear can really help with this.

And I manly focusing on the productivity and learning parts, cause another thing I really like about focus bear is it's way to promote habits, by encouraging to do them, but also being "relax" to them, meaning that is not the end of the world is you don't do them for a day or two, something that can be hard to not feel if you struggle with mental health and punish yourself up too much
## Do you personally relate to any of the challenges that Focus Bear aims to solve?
Yes, personally I struggle with keeping focus while I'm trying to do some deep work, I somehow develop a method in order to keep this focus

I manly rely on will-power in order to maintain focus, and sometimes even using productivity apps don't make difference cause I always find a way around them in order to get distractions, to me personally, is kinda rough cause I'm someone that can be hard on myself, even with the little things that in the grand scheme, doesn't matter 
## Do you know someone with ADHD or autism or even someone without a diagnosis who has struggled socially or to perform well at uni? How might Focus Bear help them?
I manly struggle with distractions in my phone, I always open apps without need it them, even just to stare at them just to distract myself. So 1 feature that Focus Bear has (and I really love it) is that every time you open an app in the block list, it gives very few seconds to think deeply if you really want to open the app, Is it important to open it?, someone might die if you don't?, this types of breaks to reflect on my tech usage really had help to stay away (at leat when I'm trying to focus) from distractions

Another thing that I love is the blog of Focus Bear, I think it gives more understanding on wy you might be in the place you are, and more importantly, to not feel alone nor isolated with with this problems.
