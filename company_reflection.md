## Why do you think Focus Bear was created?
It was created to address the needs of people with ADHD and autism (AuDHD), especially because many productivity apps assume users can rely on willpower or punishment-based systems. The product is designed to adapt to the user, rather than forcing the user to adapt to the app.

For example, Focus Bear emphasizes gentle routines and compassionate habit-building instead of rigid productivity systems. This makes it especially accessible for people who struggle with executive function or burnout.
## What problem is Focus Bear solving?
Focus Bear mainly solves problems related to productivity, habit adherence, and executive functioning. These are areas where many people with ADHD or autism struggle, especially when traditional productivity tools rely on discipline, streaks, or guilt.

One concrete example is the app blocking feature with a delay prompt. When I tried this feature, Focus Bear didn’t immediately block me harshly, instead, it gave me a few seconds to pause and reflect before opening a distracting app. That small pause made a real difference, because it interrupted my automatic habit of opening apps without thinking.
## Why do you think this mission is important?
I think this mission is important because long-term struggles with productivity can take a serious mental and physical toll. Over time, this can affect academic performance, work life, self-esteem, and personal relationships.

What makes this especially important is the stigma around productivity. People who struggle with focus are often labeled as lazy or unmotivated, which can lead to shame and self-punishment. Focus Bear’s compassionate design helps counter that narrative by treating productivity challenges as something to support, not punish.
## How does Focus Bear’s work align with your personal values or interests?
Focus Bear aligns strongly with my current goals of learning more effectively and improving my productivity without burning out. What I really appreciate is that Focus Bear promotes habits while also being forgiving. If you miss a habit for a day or two, it doesn’t feel like you’ve “failed” or ruined everything.

This approach matters a lot to me because I tend to be very hard on myself, even over small mistakes. Using an app that encourages consistency without punishment makes habit-building feel sustainable rather than stressful.
## Do you personally relate to any of the challenges that Focus Bear aims to solve?
Yes, I strongly relate. I struggle to maintain focus during deep work sessions, especially when distractions are easily accessible. I often rely heavily on willpower, which works sometimes but is unreliable long-term.

Before using Focus Bear, even productivity apps didn’t help much because I would find ways around them. What helped with Focus Bear was how it interrupts impulsive behavior instead of just blocking it, which made me more aware of my actions rather than just frustrated.
## Do you know someone with ADHD or autism or even someone without a diagnosis who has struggled socially or to perform well at uni? How might Focus Bear help them?
I personally struggle a lot with phone distractions, especially opening apps out of habit rather than intention. One Focus Bear feature I really liked was the short reflection delay when opening blocked apps. During that moment, I would ask myself questions like “Do I actually need this app right now?” or “Is this important enough to break my focus?” and often the answer was no.

Another thing I liked is Focus's Bear blog, especially this 2 posts:

### [Managing adhd burnout: practical ways to regain balance](https://www.focusbear.io/blog-post/managing-adhd-burnout-practical-ways-to-regain-balance)
I like it, not only cause it gave me a feeling of being the only one that struggles with this type of problems, but also the tips given by this post are more or less what I been trying to do since the beginning of this year (2026):
    - **Pause completely**: I'm trying to do this in the weekends, not only gives space to rest my mind, but it also promotes (at least for me) a drive to be productive on work days
    - **Ground through your senses**: I'm trying to take walks at the end of the day to calm myself.
    - **Reconnect with values**: On the weekends I tried to focus on my family and my hobbies.
### [New year resolutions with ADHD: Why falling off doesn't mean you failes](https://www.focusbear.io/blog-post/new-year-resolutions-with-adhd-why-falling-off-doesnt-mean-you-failed)
I think most people relates to this, but this posts also it feels personal, because I tend to have a all-or-nothing mindset when I set my goals, not only New years goals, so I've personally experience a lot of the symptoms describe in this post:
- Motivation loss
- Increased mental fatigue
- Irritability
- Self-blame after missing a day

I also liked the tips to approach this problem in a better way:
- **Split the goal on small manageable tasks**: I really liked this approach, cause is similar to the SMART goal approach, which a criteria to make better goals
- **Attach new habits to existing habits**: Although not new (I already read this advice in the *Atomic Habits* book) is still an useful advice

But the thing I liked the most is this final message that I tend to forget is often true:
"If your New Year resolutions have already started to slip, it doesn’t mean you failed — it means your routines were built for an ideal version of life, not the real one."
