- UNICAES Library

I'll start working from 10:00 a.m to 6:00 p.m 
	1- I'll start the day by 15 minutes of catching up to discord messages and emails if necessary
	2- I will work for about 1-2 hours using focus bear's app to log my working time
	3- After step #2 I will take a break of 15-20 minutes
	- The steps #2 and #3 will be cycle until lunch time (Lunch will be about 1 hour and will be set around 1:00 p.m or 2:00 p.m)
	- Then the cycle will continue until 5:30 p.m
	- Before ending my working days I'll reflect in the things I had done, focusing on:
		- What I did today
		- What I learn today
		- What I can do to improve
		- What I will work the next day
	This should take no more than 30 minutes

This will be the schedule in general, although some days will be a little different:
- Mondays after lunch, I'll go to UNICAES Library to work with the team here in El Salvador (from 2:30 p.m to 4:30 p.m)
- Wednesdays I'll have a virtual meeting with the team in order to update about my progress
