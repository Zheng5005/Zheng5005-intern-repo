## When do you prefer using AI vs. searching Google?
Normally I google the exact bug that React throws me, in searching not only for an answer but also an answer that follows good practices, but that isn't always the caase, some bugs aren't easy to find in any blog or documentation, in this specific case I prefer using the AI to speed up the process

Although I must admit that if I already feel competent enough, I ask AI to write code and then I tested and improve it, but this is because I feel confident enough that reading and refactoring AI code isn't a big deal to me and it accelerates the process
## How do you decide when to ask a colleague instead?
- If I've been google it and asking the AI for an answer for a long time (around 1 to 2 days of hard working)
- If is a questions related to the architecture or it has to do with sentive data
- If I need the perspective of another person regarding an implemetation
- If the task is urgent and there's no time for any search or AI usage
## What challenges do developers face when troubleshooting alone?
- **Feeling lost**: It can be because they are new to the codebase or because they have never seen the bug in their life, feeling lost is quite a normal feeling in this case
- **Feeling Overhelm**: This is similar to the previous one, a big codebase or a difficult bug can make you feel incompetent over a long period of time
- **Burnout**: This related more with the mental health of the individual, but having the responsability of fixing a difficult bug over and over for a pretty long period of time can take a toll in the mental healt of every individual
