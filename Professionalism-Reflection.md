## Have you ever experienced or witnessed great teamwork and professionalism? What made it effective?
I have experience great professionalism, I think the main thing that make it stand out is that every person in the discussion set their ego aside to reach the same goal.
- The goal was to made a system to print some bags for an client
    - Person A wanted to make things the same way that they've been doing it this whole time, but it was not that efficient
    - Person B wanted to do things quickly, but I did'nt garantige quality
- The problem comes when this 2 person with clashing ideas started to discuss this decisions, but it wasn't going anywhere
- At the end they decided to settle for a solution of person A manly cause eventhough it was a good idea to improve speed, it was very little time to design somthing like this, no ego was hurt in this process.
## What steps can you take to **make sure my communication is clear, respectful, and inclusive**?
- Effective communication
- Always coming from a place of help/empathy
- Be assertive but keep in mind other people feelings

Example: I need to inform a Co-worker that their implementation isn't the most optimal thing at the moment:
Hi! [CO-WORKER_NAME] I wanted to ask some question about [CO-WORKER_IMPLEMENTATION], at the moment it seems to risky to ship it to production, although I like your idea, maybe we can hop on a call to discuss how to implement your idea.
## How can I help **create a positive, fun, and professional work environment**?
- Having professionalism, but not entering the domain of toxic productivity
- Considering each point of view, every one has an opinion and is valid
- Be mindful of everyone schedule
## How can you prepare effectively for meetings with supervisors and colleagues?
- Bring thoughtful questions, if you can get an answer by googling it, don't ask it
- Note notes, even if you have a great memory, better safe than sorry
## What would it look like to be proactive during your internship?
- Be self leading, don't wait for other people to tell what to do next
- Ask thoughtful questions
- Prepare notes from previous meetings, it can be useful, even as a reminder
## How might you follow up with colleagues or supervisors if you need information/action from them? How would you escalate it further if you don't get a response and when would you escalate?
First if a have a question, I'll ask that person in discord, and wait for about 2-3 businesses days, if they hadn't answer it I wouldn't escalate yet, maybe they are pretty busy, I'l text a follow up message just to make sure I don't bother that person, if again after 2-3 businesses days the question isn't answered, maybe I'll text the next person in the line of charge for and answer, but I wouldn't mention the previous attempts of communication with that person.
## What are some things you won't do?
- Be rude
- Be impatient
- If they response when I already have the answer, I won't be rude or mention anything hurtful
- I won't put anyone in bad light.
