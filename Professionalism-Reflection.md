## How might you follow up with colleagues or supervisors if you need information/action from them? How would you escalate it further if you don't get a response and when would you escalate?
First if a have a question, I'll ask that person in discord, and wait for about 2-3 businesses days, if they hadn't answer it I wouldn't escalate yet, maybe they are pretty busy, I'l text a follow up message just to make sure I don't bother that person, if again after 2-3 businesses days the question isn't answered, maybe I'll text the next person in the line of charge for and answer, but I wouldn't mention the previous attempts of communication with that person.
## What are some things you won't do?
- Be rude
- Be impatient
- If they response when I already have the answer, I won't be rude or mention anything hurtful
- I won't put anyone in bad light.
