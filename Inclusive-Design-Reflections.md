## How can I **adjust my communication style** to be more inclusive of neurodivergent users and teammates?
- Be clear and concise
- Keep in mind other peoples feelings
- Coming from a place of empathy and taking account that every person struggles with different things, and those struggles are valid
- Never make the other person feel like there not being listen nor like there struggle isn't real
- Keep in mind that every person can have a different background than me, so instead on focusing on what they are lacking, focus on the things they can offer to the conversation and user experience.

## What is one **practical change** I can make in my work to better support vulnerable populations?

## Design that could make Focus Bear more accessible
I notice that, in the android version at least, the home page is kinda overwhelming at first, maybe making a space to personalized this page at the on-boarding process would be an improvement
## Response to an user that has struggles with executive functioning
**User**: I struggle with finishing projects, it seems that I have a million dollar idea every weekend, but I can't push myself to finish the project, it's very heartbreaking
**My response**: Hi **User's name**, I'm sorry to hear that you feeling like this, keep in mind that you're not alone, and also:
1. Projects can have success, but can also work as a learning lesson to apply that knowledge in other aspects in your life
2. When you find yourself having another great idea, try to breaking it down into clear and concise steps to follow, that way you can work in this ideas with a road-map in mind and you'll not feel overwhelm by the tasks
