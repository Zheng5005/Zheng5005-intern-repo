## How does Kanban help manage **priorities and avoid overload**?
- Is a clear way to see the work done and the remain work in the project
- Promotes transparency and communication between all members of the team
- It promotes pro activism, cause every member can choose in what task to work, is not impose
## How can you improve **your workflow** using Kanban principles?
- Start where I'm at, is not necessary to use Kanban from the start of the project
- Have WIP (work in progress) in every column, to prioritize completing task instead of just moving them
- Improve the backlog in every opportunity, this will improve also the developer experience
## How did I do the requested tasks?
I created a project in Github, using the template Board, which is the same as Kanban, then I linked this project with my On-boarding repo, which automatically import all open Issues into the Kanban board

The Board has 4 column:
- Todo: for Issues that I need to do.
- In Progress: For Issues in progress, I put a WIP, which is basically a limit of 3, this is to limit myself and not work on multiple Issues at the same time.
- Ready for review: Which is for Issues that I finished, but I need to double check everything
- Done: For Issues I have finished
- Bot Approved: this is for Issues that are approved by the bot, to split the Issues done and the ones that doesn't have any problem or action required.
