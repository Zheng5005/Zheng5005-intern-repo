## Which extensions did you install? Why?
- **React Developer Tools**: I installed cause is the official tool to debug react code, it also useful when you are dealing with re-renders that kind of thing
- **Redux DevTools**: It was installed cause is the official tool to debug Redux stores, and it has pretty useful features to deal with global state
- **Lighthouse**: Installed cause is a pretty useful extension to see the performance of your website, and also is backed by Google, which is a huge plus
- **JSON Viewer Pro**: I choose this extension in particular cause is the most well-rounded and feature rich of all the extension to visualize JSON responses
## What was the most useful thing you learned?
I heard about Lighthouse in the past, but to see how my apps rank in terms of optimization and performance was eye-opening, and it gives me a lot of opportunities to growth in order to improve user experience with my apps.
