## What makes Focus Bear different from these apps?
- It simplicity, a lot of the apps have many features, but at first it can be really overwhelming and even can be a factor for paralysis-by-analysis
- The Habit system, even though some apps have a similar way of implement it, the fact that Focus Bear shows a video I think it contributes to ease the habit into the user.
## If you were a user, why would you choose Focus Bear over competitors?
I would choose it for different reasons:
- It's ease to set up a deep work session
- It's simplicity
- The AI integration, it can be useful
## What’s one feature that other apps have that Focus Bear doesn’t?
- Even tough Focus Bear shines for it's simplicity, it lacks some features for task management, a Kanban board for example.
## Based on your research, what’s one improvement you think Focus Bear could make?
- Even though It has streaks, it would be helpful to display it somewhere visible at first glance, to promote adherence to an habit.
- Again, even though it has routing sharing, it could benefit from having a more visible way of knowing it has this feature
