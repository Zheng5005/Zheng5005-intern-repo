## What security measures do I currently follow, and where can I improve?
- I use strong passwords
- I also use 2FA when possible
- I don't run any suspicious script before I examine the script itself.
- I don't download any file from a suspicious website, and if the website looks alright, I make sure to read carefully and do research in order to protect myself

Where I can improve?
Currently I don't lock my devices every time I'm far from them, it a window of improvement that I can implement
## How can I make **secure behaviour a habit** rather than an afterthought?
- Making sure every time I setup a new machine, I create a whole new password specific for that device
- Using 2FA in every possible app
- Encrypting my hard drive, in case the device is stolen
- Use a isolated account to store any sensitive data that can be damaging in case of a breach-
## What steps will I take to ensure your **passwords and accounts** are secure?
1. Using specials characters
2. Making them 8-12 characters long
3. Using things not are not link with me, for example I don't like playing online games, so I don't play Warzone, using the name of a map can secure a little bit the password cause the hacker wouldn't guess by studying my interest
## What would I do if I suspected a **security breach** or suspicious activity on my account?
1. Check any devices that are in sync with my account and deleting any devices that I can't recognize
2. Check any suspicious email or message that can lead to the cause of the breach
3. Make sure to security of any sensible information that could be compromised
4. Commenting this discoveries with the people that I know, in order to protect them
## New cyber security habit I will be implementing
- Locking my computer and phone in order to protect my data.
