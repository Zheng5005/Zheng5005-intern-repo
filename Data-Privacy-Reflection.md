## Habits and learning
For my habits that I'll be implementing:
- Using MFA for the majority of my apps
- Using encryption in my hard drive

And the learning:
- Phishing ignorance is one of the great factors in security breach, so read carefully who is the sender of an email will be implemented
- Never share any type of credentials with someone, even a co-worker
