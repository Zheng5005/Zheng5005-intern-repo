## Which terminal client did you choose? Why?
- For Linux distros I normally use the integrated terminal in those, in this case the distro is Ubuntu
- For Windows I normally use PowerShell, I do it cause it adds features compare to the default terminal Windows uses
## What customizations (if any) did you make?
- For Windows I didn't make any customization
- For Ubuntu I normally change the default font to **DepartureMono Nerd Font Mono** and also I made some aliases that improve file navigation
## What was the most useful command you learned today?
I like to watch my RAM usage for any app, so a useful command for this is **top**, which let's do exactly that, basically is like the task manager of Windows in the Linux terminal
