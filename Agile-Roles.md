## What is **your role**, and how does it contribute to the Agile process?
In my case, the area I will be working is Frontend, so it falls in the **Developer** role, so its responsible for building high-quality increments in the product, it also ensure the definition of done (DoD) is met, it also collaborates with the sprints plannings and execution to ensure a quality increment.
## How do your responsibilities overlap or interact with other roles in the team?
Developers (in this specific case frontend developers) interact with differents roles in an agile setting:
- **QA**: to ensure the UI/UX is good and doesn't impact the user in a negative way
	- I can Improve the teamwork with this role by creating automatic tests in my code and testing manually the new/existing functionality
- **UI/UX**: to make sure the design are well done and it adds value to the product
- **Product manager**: To ensure the design and functionalities of the app are what the app requires and is what users want.
