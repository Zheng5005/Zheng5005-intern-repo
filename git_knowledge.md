## Have you used Git before? If so, in what context?
Yes, I've used Git trough my college experience and using it to versioning my personal projects, although I only have work in small teams (4-5 people) so using git wasn't a Issue nor it cause a lot of merge problems
## Which Git client (if any) did you choose? Why?
I didn't choose a Client, Although the Git integration in VSCode can be considered one, cause I feel comfortable with using Linux directly in the terminal, I even have some aliases in order to visualize in a better way the whole branch and its commits.
## What was the most interesting thing you learned about Git today?
Even though I used Git in the pass, I never work with Git hooks, manly cause the existence of them is kinda new to me, I always that this types of actions are manage through **Github Actions** or any **CI/CD** pipeline
