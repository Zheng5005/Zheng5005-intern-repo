## Things that seems confusing, frustrating or unclear
1. Home page seems overwhelming at first
2. If you go to the settings page, and enter language setting, is kinda confusing why the're many moods to speak English, but not actual languages, it's a good feature to customize the app, but kinda confusing at first
3. When I try to open an app that is in the blocked list, the display with the message asking if I really want to open the app opens and closes numerous times before showing the complete message.
4. When I change the mood of English to **Sassy**, the text **Your mourning ritual*** from the **Habits** tabs of the home page isn't responsive
5. It's kinda confusing having a **Stats** page in the app, but having a button in the **Settings** page that says shows your stats, only to open other view.
## How can the on-boarding process be improve
1. Having a space to customize the main page in order to have a more clean setup
