## What equipment changes can I make to improve my workspace setup?
For my case, my desktop is kinda small, but with enough space for a 27' monitor and to have my laptop to the side of the monitor, actually last year (2025) I bought a monitor this exact size, and I also use an external mouse and keyboard in order to improve my workspace, and have a clean setup.

Although my chair needs improving still, buying a new chair to improve my posture will be a game changer.

## What behavioural changes can I make to improve posture and reduce strain?
Again my monitor in kinda small and short, so putting some books under the monitor will improve my posture, also will cause me to sit more upright.

Also another game changer will to take breaks regularly, cause at the moment I only take breaks when my body is screaming for one, I will work on this with Focus Bear app.

## How can I remind yourself to **maintain good posture and take breaks** throughout the day?
As I said before, I'll be using Focus Bear app to do exactly that.
