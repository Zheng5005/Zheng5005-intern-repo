# Issue #32
## What challenges did you face during setup?
Because I already have exprience with react in personal projects I didn't have any challenges during set-up, but if I were new I think I would haave problems with:
- Choosing the tool to create the project, should I use **Vite** or **create-react-app**
    - In this case I choose **Vite** cause I'm more familiar with it and is more up to date with modern web development tools
