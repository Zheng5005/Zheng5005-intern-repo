## What challenges did you face while setting up i18next?
The installation was kite easy, but setting up the project was confusing at first, manly cause I didn't know where to import the example provided by the official documentation for it to work

Also once a had the project setup, the next hard thing was to make the translations respect the original text format
## Why is it important to use a library like i18next instead of manually handling translations?
Manually handling translations is very difficult, even on small apps, and It can slow the work of the whole team in even larger apps, by using libraries like i18next, you can have a more centrilized and standarized form of translation control throughout the whole apps
## How would you handle dynamic content (e.g., user-generated text) in a multilingual app?
A general advice would be that user-generated texts are not translated, cause otherwise it takes control from the user.

But you can translate some common words for example:
`"{{user}} added a comment"`: here the whole message can be translated, exept for the username 

Another thing you can do in case you need to store the user-generated text, is to save them with their language code, this can be used later to filter or detect the language.

And case you really need to translate the text, you can use external APIs that can help you with that, for example Google
## Tasks
I ran the following command:
`npm install react-i18next i18next --save`

Then based on a example from the official documentation of i18next, I made a i18n.js file, which has dynamic text for the HelloWorld component and also dynamic text for the Counter componente, the last one also manage plurals, somthing that was kite tricky at the beggining:
```i18n.js
import i18n from "i18next";
import { initReactI18next } from "react-i18next";

const resources = {
  en: {
    translation: {
      welcomeMessage: "Hello {{name}}",
      counterText_one: "You have clicked the button <1>{{count}}</1> time",
      counterText_other: "You have clicked the button <1>{{count}}</1> times",
    }
  },
  es: {
    translation: {
      welcomeMessage: "Hola {{name}}",
      counterText_one: "Haz presionado el boton <1>{{count}}</1> vez",
      counterText_other: "Haz presionado el boton <1>{{count}}</1> veces"
    }
  },
  it: {
    translation: {
      welcomeMessage: "Ciao {{name}}",
      counterText_one: "Hai cliccato sul pulsante <1>{{count}}</1> volta",
      counterText_other: "Hai cliccato sul pulsante <1>{{count}}</1> volte"
    }
  },
  ge: {
    translation: {
      welcomeMessage: "Hallo {{name}}",
      counterText_one: "Sie haben die Schaltfläche <1>{{count}}</1> Mal angeklickt.",
      counterText_other: "Sie haben die Schaltfläche <1>{{count}}</1> Mal angeklickt."
    }
  }
};

i18n
  .use(initReactI18next) // passes i18n down to react-i18next
  .init({
    resources,
    fallbackLng: 'en', // In case of 'lng' is not supported, it would fallback to english
    lng: "es", // language to use

    interpolation: {
      escapeValue: false // react already safes from xss
    }
  });

  export default i18n;
```

Usage in HelloWorld.jsx
```HelloWorld.jsx
import { useTranslation } from "react-i18next";
import FormikComponent from "./FormikComponent";

export default function HelloWorld({name}) {
  const { t } = useTranslation()

  return (
    <>
      <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold underline">{t('welcomeMessage', {name: name})}</h1>
      <FormikComponent />
    </>
  )
}
```

Usage in Counter.jsx
```Counter.jsx
import { Trans } from "react-i18next";

export default function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div className="flex flex-col items-center gap-4 rounded-lg bg-gray-100 p-6 shadow-md">
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-800">
        {/*You have clicked the button <span className="font-semibold">{count}</span>{" "}
        times */}
        <Trans 
          i18nKey="counterText" 
          count={count} 
          components={{
            1: <span className="font-semibold" />
          }} />
      </p>

      <button
        type="button"
        onClick={() => setCount((c) => c + 1)}
        className="rounded-md bg-blue-600 px-4 py-2 text-white transition hover:bg-blue-700 focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-blue-400 hover:cursor-pointer"
      >
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

I also needed to import the whole i18n.js file in the main.jsx file, this can be accomplish by adding this simple line:
`import './utils/i18n.js'`
