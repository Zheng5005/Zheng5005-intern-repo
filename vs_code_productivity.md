## Top 10 shortcuts
### **Navigation**
- **Ctrl + F**: find text in the current page
- **Ctrl + Shift + F**: find text in all files of the directory
- **Ctrl + B**: To toggle side bar, this is something important for me, cause seeing all files at once makes me overwhelm for some reason, like every file is a task, and seeing all at once is kinda stressful.
