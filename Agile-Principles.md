## What do you think are the biggest **benefits and challenges** of Agile?
Benefits:
- The focus on customer satisfaction
- Collaboration of all the people that are involved (including users and stakeholders)
Challenges:
- Change can be quite overwhelming at first
- The planning phases can be more time consuming at the begging
## How can Agile principles help improve **your role and responsibilities**?
The principles of agile can improve my role by giving a framework to deliver value to the users, having a mental framework that embraces change and collaboration is crucial for teamwork, something that agile principles can give.

But the principle that I think is the most useful for my role (Frontend developer) is **Customer Satisfaction**, cause at the end of the day, the interfaces and functionality will be the things the user interact the most, even though any page can use and API and other things, but a well put together design, that keep in mind the needs of the user, is something that can make or break a product
## Scrum vs Kanban
These 2 methodologies can seem similar at first glance, but the implementation in wildly different, Kanban embraces change at any state, and doesn't define roles, giving more flexibility to the team, but in the other hand, this can be chaotic in big projects.

In contrast Scrum follows a more structured approach, with defined roles, and embrace change but in cycles (sprints), this can be hard to manage in a pretty unpredictable projects that grow extremely fast
