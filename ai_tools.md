## Which AI tools did you try?
During my college experience I always rely on ChatGPT for questions and some implementations, but in this last days I've been trying other AI's tools like Gemini and Claude
## What worked well? What didn’t?
In my experience, maybe it's because I'm still starting to use Agentic AI, when you ask questions and snippets of code in a Chatbot, it works pretty well although still needs a code review to adjust it to the project needs, styles, etc.

But agentic AI, although powerful, give the impression that it requires a pay model in order to be more helpful, I tried it in a personal project, a Spotify clone, to fix a bug that makes the played song sound pretty laggy, and at first glance it solved the bug, but the moment I run it it sounded even worse.
Although I have to admit that the AI could identify the piece of code that is causing the bug without any assistance.
## When do you think AI is most useful for coding?
- To learn something, it can be use as a personal teacher to ask questions
- When you already know the thing you are asking for, a implementation for example, so you can review the code that the AI returns, boosting productivity
- Repetitive tasks
